# Identifiers in python

# identifiers is nothing but just the variable_name, function_name, class_name and object_name.

# Rules for writing identifiers
# Identifiers can be a combination of letters in lowercase (a to z) or uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9)
# or an underscore _. Names like myClass, var_1 and print_this_to_screen, all are valid example.
# An identifier cannot start with a digit. 1variable is invalid, but variable1 is a valid name.
# We cannot use special symbols like !, @, #, $, % etc. in our identifier.


# constant : must be in upper-case
MAX = 100
# camelCase
variableName = 'Generally, used for declaring variable name.'
# PascalCase
ClassName = 'Generally, used for declaring class name.'
# snake_case
CONSTANT_NAME = "Generally, used for declaring constant name."
database_field_name = "Generally, used for declaring database table column name."
# kebab-case
# url-name = "Generally, used in url names."
